# HTML
## text
##### One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly, All the text you read on the websites , for example, whether it's the titles at the top of the page, the section headers,is made from HTML text elements.
#### some elements of html text
#### paragraph element.
#### The heading elements.
#### Text formatting elements.
## Introduction CSS
### Cascading Style Sheets
#### CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets,an extension to basic HTML that allows you to style your web pages. It is what you’d use if you wanted to change the color of some text or create simple animations. That and limitless other styling options are possible with the use of CSS. Essentially, every website, however shiny, by CSS
####  There are now three versions of CSS, and they are commonly referred to as CSS1, CSS2, and CSS3 and Each new version builds on the prior one:
#### CSS1 controls fonts, colors, and text attributes
#### CSS2 controls layout and positioning
#### CSS3 provides more control of color, transparency, and more robust ways to target specific devices .
# JAVA SCRIPT 
## Basic JavaScript Instructions
* JavaScript is case-sensitive.
* Statements should end in a semicolon (;).
* Variables:

* Must be defined before being used. The variable name can contain A – Z, a – z, underscore or digits and must start with a letter or an underscore (“_”).
* Assume the type of the data that is put into the variable. The data type does not have to be explicitly defined
* Are global variables when defined outside of a function, and are available anywhere in the current script context. Variables created within a function are local variables, and can be used only within that function.
* Strings have to be enclosed in quotation marks, either a single or double. For example: print(”Hello ” + ‘world ‘+ Country.name) produces the following: Hello world US.
* Special characters that are displayed literally must be preceded by a backslash character (\). Quotes within a string can be entered preceded by a backslash as well.
* To increment a variable, such as a = a + 1, you can use a++. You can decrement a variable in the same way, as in a--.
* To enter comments in the script, use "//" to start a single line comment or the combination of "/*" and "*/" to enclose a multi-line comment.
* Values that are not defined as a data type (string, number, Boolean) may be defined as an object, such as Date, Array, Boolean, String, and Number. As an example you could define: var ArrayList=new Array(”test”, ” this”, ” list”);.
* Dots in Service Manager field names must be replaced by an underscore (_) in JavaScript. For example contact.name becomes contact_name.
* Service Manager field names that are reserved words in JavaScript have to be preceded by an underscore, such as “_class” for the “class” field.
## Decisions and Loops
####  how decision making is implemented in JavaScript and how one can use it to make the code smarter. In JavaScript, the flow of the code's execution can be changed depending on whether a condition is true or false, using an ’if’ statement or a switch statement. The chapter introduces some new operators that are essential for the definition of conditions. Comparison operators have a left‐hand side (LHS) and a right‐hand side (RHS). The ’if’ statement is used in almost every program that is more than a couple of lines long. The while loop is useful for looping through some code for as long as a test condition remains true. The ’do … while’ loop executes the code once and then keeps executing the code as long as the test condition remains true.
