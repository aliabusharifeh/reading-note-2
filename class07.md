##### A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.

##### HTML table tag is used to display data in tabular form (row * column). There can be many columns in a row.

##### We can create a table to display data in tabular form, using <table> element, with the help of <tr> , <td>, and <th> elements.

##### In Each table, table row is defined by <tr> tag, table header is defined by <th>, and table data is defined by <td> tags.

##### HTML tables are used to manage the layout of the page e.g. header section, navigation bar, body content, footer section etc. But it is recommended to use div tag over table to manage the layout of the page .

### Functions 
#### The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.

### method 
#### A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.

####  The variable str in the example above stores the string ‘CodeCADEMY’. The .toLowerCase() and .toUpperCase() methods in the example above are called on str. Let’s talk through each line:

#### On the second line, the .toLowerCase() method is called on the str variable, which returns the lowercase string 'codecademy'.
#### On the third line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the str variable, which returns the uppercase string 'CODECADEMY'. Notice, periods are used to call a method on an object, as in str.toLowerCase();.

#### A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.
### objects
#### Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

#### Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
#### An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
#### Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
