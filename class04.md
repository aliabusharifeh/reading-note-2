# HTML
## links
#### Links are essential in HTML, as the Web was initially designed to be an information network of documents linked between each other.

#### The “HyperText” part of HTML defines what kind of links we use: hypertext links, a.k.a hyperlinks.

#### In HTML, links are inline elements written with the <a> tag.

#### The href attribute (hypertext reference) is used to define the target of the link (where you navigate to when you click).
### for example:
##### <p>
##### ..... for more info please visit <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>.
##### </p>

#### Links are the primary interaction of a webpage: you V  navigate from one document to another by clicking on links.

#### There are 3 types of target you can define.

* anchor targets, to navigate within the same page
* relative URLs, usually to navigate within the same website
* absolute URLs, usually to navigate to another website.
## layout

#### HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.

#### Web page layout is the most important part to keep in mind while creating a website so that our website can appear professional with the great look. You can also use CSS and JAVASCRIPT based frameworks for creating layouts for responsive and dynamic website designing.

### Functions 
#### The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.

### method 
#### A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.

####  The variable str in the example above stores the string ‘CodeCADEMY’. The .toLowerCase() and .toUpperCase() methods in the example above are called on str. Let’s talk through each line:

#### On the second line, the .toLowerCase() method is called on the str variable, which returns the lowercase string 'codecademy'.
#### On the third line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the str variable, which returns the uppercase string 'CODECADEMY'. Notice, periods are used to call a method on an object, as in str.toLowerCase();.

#### A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.
### objects
#### Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

#### Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
#### An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
#### Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
